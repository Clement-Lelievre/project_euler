# I see two things that will help me find the value:
# 1) at the limit, when numbers are infinite, we have the equation:
# (1/p)Â² = 1/2 => 1/p = 1/sqrt(2)
# because when numbers are big enough, removing one disc has no effect on the ratio
# 2) The ratio value should be monotonic (I think), so I can stop whenever I cross the 0.5 value
# 3) (I got help for this observation:) observe that the ratio of solutions converges to ~ 5.8284..., I can then use that fact to fast forward to the solution
